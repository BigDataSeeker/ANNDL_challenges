This repo contains the description and the code used during the deveopments of deep learning models to solve the Challenges during the course Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learing in 2023/24 A. Y. at PoliMi held on [codalab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/16245) platform.

### Challenge 1

This challenge required to classify plants into two categories according to their state of health i.e. a binary classification problem. For evaluation accuracy metric was used.

### Challenge 12

This challenge required to predict future samples of the input time series. The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequences to correctly predict the future. The task is to develop a forecasting model that is able to predict several uncorrelated time series. The prerequisite is that the model exhibits generalisation capabilities in the forecasting domain, allowing it to transcend the constraints of specific time domains. This requires a model that, while specialised in forecasting, is not limited to predicting in a single or predefined time context.
